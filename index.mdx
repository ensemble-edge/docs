# Ensemble Edge

**Version control meets edge orchestration for AI systems.**

Build AI workflows that you actually control. No proprietary platforms, no vendor lock-in, no serverless sprawl, no duct tape and bailing wire "workflow automation." Just Git, YAML, and Cloudflare Workers.

You're an engineer. You deserve tools that treat you like one.

## The Problem

You've got 50+ prompts, 20+ agents, dozens of SQL queries scattered across your codebase. Change one, break three others. Rollback means Git archaeology. A/B testing means deployment hell.

And every "AI orchestration platform" wants you to hand over control to some black box that the head of sales bought because the pitch deck looked good.

**You know there's a better way.**

## Components → Agents → Ensembles

The building blocks are simple:

<CardGroup cols={3}>
  <Card title="Components" icon="cube">
    **Versioned artifacts**: prompts, configs, queries, scripts. Each gets its own version history. Mix and match optimal versions from different points in time.
  </Card>

  <Card title="Agents" icon="robot">
    **Workers that execute**: AI reasoning, database queries, HTTP calls, business logic. Each agent uses operations and components to get work done.
  </Card>

  <Card title="Ensembles" icon="network-wired">
    **Orchestration workflows**: YAML files that coordinate agents into complex workflows. Execute at the edge in <50ms cold starts.
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## Edgit: Git-Native Component Versioning

Version every AI component independently. Deploy any combination from any point in history. Rollback in <50ms globally.

```bash
# Each component versions independently
edgit tag create extraction-prompt v1.0.0
edgit tag create company-agent v2.1.0
edgit tag create validation-query v0.5.0

# Deploy the optimal combination - cherry-pick from history
edgit deploy set extraction-prompt v0.1.0 --to prod  # Ancient but perfect
edgit deploy set company-agent v3.0.0 --to prod      # Latest stable
edgit deploy set validation-query v2.5.0 --to prod   # Best performance

# Instant rollback
edgit deploy set extraction-prompt v0.1.0 --to prod  # < 50ms globally
```

**No merge conflicts. No monorepo hell. No JSON state files.**

All version data lives in Git tags. Your CI/CD deploys to Cloudflare KV. Every version ever created is instantly accessible at the edge.

## Conductor: YAML-Driven Edge Orchestration

Define AI workflows in YAML. Execute at 200+ global locations. Sub-50ms cold starts. No DAG builders, no UI-driven workflows, no central orchestrator bottleneck.

```yaml
# ensembles/company-intelligence.yaml
name: company-intelligence

agents:
  - name: fetch-company-data
    operation: http
    config:
      url: https://api.example.com/companies/${input.domain}
      cache_ttl: 3600

  - name: analyze-financials
    operation: think
    component: financial-analysis-prompt@v2.1.0
    config:
      model: claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022
    input:
      company_data: ${fetch-company-data.output}

  - name: generate-report
    operation: think
    component: report-generation-prompt@v1.5.0
    input:
      analysis: ${analyze-financials.output}
```

**Define workflows in Git. Deploy to Cloudflare Workers. State management, caching, parallelization built-in.**

## The Versioning Multiverse

With independent versioning of components AND agents, you unlock infinite combinations:

```yaml
# Same ensemble, different realities running in parallel
ensemble: analysis-pipeline

agents:
  # Production: stable + conservative
  - name: prod-analyzer
    agent: analyzer@v1.0.0        # Stable agent version
    component: prompt@v1.0.0      # Conservative prompt

  # Experimental: new everything
  - name: exp-analyzer
    agent: analyzer@v2.0.0-beta   # New agent logic
    component: prompt@v2.1.0      # Aggressive prompt

  # Hybrid: stable agent, new prompt
  - name: hybrid-analyzer
    agent: analyzer@v1.0.0        # Stable agent
    component: prompt@v2.1.0      # New prompt only
```

**Test: 2 agent versions × 3 prompt versions × 2 configs = 12 variants running simultaneously.**

Perfect for A/B testing, progressive rollouts, and reproducing bugs from last Tuesday at 2:47 PM.

## Why This Exists

Modern AI development is broken:

1. Ship v1.0.0 of your app
2. Change a prompt
3. Everything becomes v2.0.0
4. Original prompt trapped in Git history
5. Can't A/B test old vs new
6. Can't mix optimal versions
7. Rollback means reverting the entire codebase

**This is insane for systems with 100+ independently evolving components.**

Ensemble Edge treats AI components like they deserve: individually versioned, independently deployable, infinitely composable.

Then orchestrates them at the edge where they execute fast and scale infinitely.

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion icon="globe" title="Edge-First">
    Cloudflare Workers, KV, D1, R2, and AI Gateway are the primitives. No centralized compute. No single point of failure.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion icon="git-alt" title="Git-Native">
    Configuration, orchestration, and versioning live in Git. No proprietary storage. You own the source of truth.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion icon="bolt" title="Cache-Central">
    Multi-layer caching with TTL control. Agent-level cache settings. Cache-first thinking reduces costs and latency by 10x.

  <Accordion icon="check-square" title="Structured Outputs">
    AI operations produce machine-readable, type-safe output validated via JSON schema. No string parsing, no hallucinated JSON.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion icon="chart-line" title="Observable by Default">
    Every execution emits structured logs and metrics. Debugging and monitoring are effortless, not afterthoughts.
