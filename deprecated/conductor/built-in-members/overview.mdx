## Usage

Built-in members are referenced by name in ensemble definitions:

```yaml
name: example-workflow
description: Using built-in members

flow:
  # Scrape a website
  - member: scrape
    type: Scrape
    input:
      url: "https://example.com"

  # Validate the scraped content
  - member: validate-content
    type: Validate
    input:
      data: ${scrape.output.content}
      rules:
        minLength: 100

  # Transform the data
  - member: transform
    type: Transform
    input:
      data: ${scrape.output}
      expression: "{ title: title, excerpt: content[0..200] }"

output:
  result: ${transform.output}
```

## Built-In vs Custom Members

### When to Use Built-In Members

✅ **Use built-in members when:**
- The functionality matches your needs exactly
- You want zero configuration
- Edge performance is critical
- You need battle-tested reliability
- You're prototyping quickly

### When to Create Custom Members

✅ **Create custom members when:**
- You need specialized business logic
- Integration with proprietary systems
- Complex multi-step operations
- Reusable components across projects
- Team-specific patterns

## Composition Patterns

### Sequential Processing

```yaml
flow:
  - member: scrape-content
    type: Scrape

  - member: validate-content
    type: Validate

  - member: transform-content
    type: Transform

  - member: save-content
    type: Function
```

### Parallel + Aggregate

```yaml
flow:
  parallel:
    - member: scrape-site-1
      type: Scrape
    - member: scrape-site-2
      type: Scrape
    - member: scrape-site-3
      type: Scrape

  - member: combine-results
    type: Transform
    input:
      data:
        - ${scrape-site-1.output}
        - ${scrape-site-2.output}
        - ${scrape-site-3.output}
```

### Validation + Retry

```yaml
flow:
  - member: generate-content
    type: Think

  - member: validate-quality
    type: Validate
    scoring:
      onFailure: retry
      retryLimit: 5

  - member: human-review
    condition: ${validate-quality.output.score < 0.8}
    type: HITL
```

## Performance Optimization

### Use Built-In Members for Speed

```yaml
# ✅ Fast - built-in Transform member
- member: transform
  type: Transform
  input:
    expression: "{ title: title, excerpt: content[0..200] }"

# ❌ Slower - custom Function member
- member: transform
  type: Function
  # Custom logic slower than optimized built-in
```

### Cache Aggressively

```yaml
- member: scrape
  type: Scrape
  cache:
    ttl: 3600  # Cache for 1 hour
```

### Parallel Execution

```yaml
parallel:
  - member: fetch-api-1
    type: Fetch
  - member: fetch-api-2
    type: Fetch
  - member: scrape-site
    type: Scrape
```

## Error Handling

Built-in members have consistent error handling:

```yaml
- member: scrape
  type: Scrape
  retry:
    maxAttempts: 3
    backoff: exponential
  continue_on_error: true

- member: handle-error
  condition: ${!scrape.success}
  type: Function
```

## Testing Built-In Members

```typescript
import { describe, it, expect } from 'vitest';
import { TestConductor } from '@ensemble-edge/conductor/testing';

describe('built-in members', () => {
  it('should scrape website', async () => {
    const conductor = await TestConductor.create({
      mocks: {
        http: {
          responses: {
            'https://example.com': {
              status: 200,
              body: '<html><body><h1>Hello</h1></body></html>'
            }
          }
        }
      }
    });

    const result = await conductor.executeMember('scrape', {
      url: 'https://example.com'
    });

    expect(result).toBeSuccessful();
    expect(result.output.content).toContain('Hello');
  });

  it('should validate content', async () => {
    const conductor = await TestConductor.create();

    const result = await conductor.executeMember('validate', {
      data: { title: 'Test', body: 'Content here' },
      rules: {
        hasTitle: "data.title != null"
      }
    });

    expect(result).toBeSuccessful();
    expect(result.output.passed).toBe(true);
  });
});
```

## Migration from Custom Members

If you have custom members that duplicate built-in functionality:

```yaml
# Before: Custom fetch member
- member: my-custom-fetch
  type: Function
  # Complex custom HTTP logic

# After: Built-in Fetch member
- member: fetch-data
  type: Fetch
  config:
    url: "https://api.example.com"
```

**Benefits:**
- Less code to maintain
- Better performance
- Automatic updates
- Battle-tested reliability

## Best Practices

1. **Prefer built-ins** - Use built-in members when available
2. **Compose freely** - Mix built-in and custom members
3. **Cache strategically** - Set appropriate TTLs
