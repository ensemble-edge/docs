<Warning>
  **Coming Soon** - Ensemble Cloud is currently in the design phase. This documentation is a preview of planned features.
</Warning>

## What is Ensemble Cloud?

Ensemble Cloud is a managed service that provides a visual interface for editing, versioning, and testing your prompts, SQL queries, and configurations. Unlike other platforms, your data stays in Git—we're just the UI layer.

**The key difference**: Your repository is the source of truth. We provide the editing experience, you own the data.

## Planned Features

## Git-Native Architecture

Think PromptLayer's editing experience, but Git-native instead of proprietary storage.

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion icon="git-alt" title="Your Repo, Your Data">
    All changes are committed to your Git repository. No lock-in, no proprietary database.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion icon="cube" title="Powered by Edgit">
    Uses Edgit's versioning system under the hood. All CLI commands work with Cloud changes.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion icon="code-branch" title="Standard Git Workflow">
    Create branches, open PRs, run CI/CD—just like code. Because it is code.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion icon="shield-halved" title="Bring Your Own Git">
    Connect your GitHub, GitLab, or Bitbucket. We never store your components.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>
