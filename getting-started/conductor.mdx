<Warning>
  **Coming Soon** - Conductor is currently in development. This is a preview of the planned quick start experience.
</Warning>

## What You'll Build

In this guide, you'll:

1. Install Conductor CLI
2. Define a simple workflow
3. Register agents from Edgit
4. Execute your first orchestrated workflow
5. Monitor execution and results

## Prerequisites

- **Edgit** installed and initialized
- **Node.js** v18 or higher
- At least one agent registered in Edgit
- Basic familiarity with YAML

## Planned Quick Start

### Step 1: Install Conductor

```bash
npm install -g @ensemble/conductor
```

### Step 2: Initialize Conductor

```bash
cd your-project
conductor init
```

### Step 3: Register an Agent

```bash
# Agent is already in Edgit
edgit add agent email-processor src/agents/email.ts

# Conductor auto-discovers it
conductor agents list
# Output: email-processor (v1.0.0)
```

### Step 4: Define a Workflow

```yaml
# workflows/email-workflow.yaml
name: email-processing
version: 1.0.0

triggers:
  - event: email.received

steps:
  - id: process
    agent: email-processor
    input:
      email: ${{ event.email }}
```

### Step 5: Deploy Workflow

```bash
# Register workflow
edgit add workflow email-processing workflows/email-workflow.yaml

# Deploy to Conductor
conductor deploy email-processing v1.0.0
```

### Step 6: Trigger Workflow

```bash
# Simulate event
conductor trigger email.received \
  --data '{"email":{"from":"test@example.com","subject":"Hello"}}'

# View execution
conductor executions list
conductor executions show <execution-id>
```

## Coming Soon

Complete quick start documentation will be available when Conductor launches.

## Meanwhile, Use Edgit

While Conductor is in development, you can prepare by:

1. **Organize your agents** in Edgit's component registry
2. **Version your agents** with Git tags
3. **Track deployments** with Edgit deploy commands
4. **Plan workflows** by documenting agent interactions
