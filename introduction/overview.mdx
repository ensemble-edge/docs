# Overview

Ensemble Edge is a developer-first platform for building AI workflows that you actually control.

## What It Is

**Two open-source tools that work together:**

1. **Edgit** - Git-native versioning for AI components (prompts, configs, queries, scripts)
2. **Conductor** - Edge orchestration framework that runs AI workflows on Cloudflare Workers

**Plus a future managed service:**

3. **Ensemble Cloud** - UI layer for managing components and workflows (Git remains the source of truth)

## The Philosophy

You're a self-respecting engineer. You know SQL. You write code. You understand infrastructure.

You don't need a "no-code AI platform" that abstracts away control. You don't want some black box that a business analyst picked because the demo looked shiny.

**You want:**
- Full control over your AI workflows
- Git as the source of truth
- No vendor lock-in
- Fast execution at the edge
- Independent versioning for every component
- The ability to A/B test anything
- Instant rollbacks without redeploying everything

## How It Works

### 1. Components (The Building Blocks)

Components are versioned artifacts that agents use during execution:

- **Prompts** (`.md`) - AI instructions and templates
- **Configs** (`.json`, `.yaml`) - Settings and parameters
- **Queries** (`.sql`) - Database queries
- **Scripts** (`.js`, `.ts`) - Reusable functions

Each component gets its own version history via Git tags. You can mix and match optimal versions from different points in time.

```bash
# Create independent versions
edgit tag create extraction-prompt v1.0.0
edgit tag create analysis-config v2.1.0
edgit tag create validation-query v0.5.0

# Deploy optimal combination
edgit deploy set extraction-prompt v1.0.0 --to prod
edgit deploy set analysis-config v2.1.0 --to prod
edgit deploy set validation-query v0.5.0 --to prod
```

### 2. Agents (The Workers)

Agents are executable units that perform tasks using operations and components:

```yaml
agents:
  - name: analyzer
    operation: think              # AI reasoning
    component: prompt@v2.1.0      # Versioned prompt
    config:
      model: claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022
      temperature: 0.7

  - name: fetcher
    operation: http               # HTTP requests
    config:
      url: https://api.example.com/data
      cache_ttl: 3600

  - name: processor
    operation: code               # Custom logic
    script: transform@v1.5.0      # Versioned script
```

### 3. Ensembles (The Orchestration)

Ensembles are YAML files that coordinate agents into workflows:

```yaml
ensemble: company-intelligence

agents:
  - name: fetch-data
    operation: http
    config:
      url: https://api.example.com/companies/${input.domain}

  - name: analyze
    operation: think
    component: analysis-prompt@v2.1.0
    input:
      data: ${fetch-data.output}

  - name: score
    agent: validator         # Use pre-built agent
    input:
      content: ${analyze.output}
```

Ensembles execute at the edge on Cloudflare Workers with <50ms cold starts.

## Key Benefits

### Independent Versioning

Version components and agents separately. Deploy optimal combinations:

```yaml
# Stable agent + experimental prompt
analyzer@v1.0.0 + analysis-prompt@v3.0.0-beta

# Latest agent + proven prompt
analyzer@v2.1.0 + analysis-prompt@v1.0.0

# Run both in parallel for A/B testing
```

### Edge Execution

Workflows run on Cloudflare's global network:
- **<50ms cold starts** (not seconds like traditional orchestrators)
- **200+ locations** worldwide
- **Infinite scale** without managing servers
- **Built-in caching** via KV and AI Gateway

### Git-Native

Everything lives in Git:
- Components versioned via Git tags
- Ensembles are YAML files in your repo
- Agent definitions are code in your repo
- No proprietary storage, no vendor database

### Observable

Every execution emits structured logs and metrics:
- Trace agent execution
- Monitor performance
- Debug issues
- Track costs

## What Makes This Different

### vs. Traditional Orchestrators (Airflow, Temporal, Prefect)

❌ **Them:** Centralized servers, slow cold starts, complex deployment
✅ **Us:** Edge-native, <50ms cold starts, deploy like any Cloudflare Worker

### vs. AI Platforms (LangChain, LlamaIndex agents)

❌ **Them:** Monolithic versioning, no independent component versions
✅ **Us:** Each component versions independently, mix optimal versions from history

### vs. "No-Code" Tools

❌ **Them:** Black box, vendor lock-in, UI-driven config in their database
✅ **Us:** Full control, Git as source of truth, code-first with optional UI

### vs. Workflow Tools (n8n, Zapier)

❌ **Them:** Visual builders, JSON config, centralized execution
✅ **Us:** YAML in Git, edge execution, developer-first

## Architecture Overview

```
Components (Git Tags)
    ↓
Agents (Operations + Components)
    ↓
Ensembles (YAML Workflows)
    ↓
Conductor Runtime (Cloudflare Workers)
    ↓
Edge Execution (200+ locations)
```

**Three layers, cleanly separated:**

1. **What you version** - Components (Edgit manages this)
2. **What executes** - Agents (Conductor orchestrates this)
3. **How it flows** - Ensembles (YAML defines this)
