## Core Terms

### Component

**What:** A versioned artifact stored in Git that can be independently versioned and deployed.

**Types:** Prompts (`.md`), configs (`.json`/`.yaml`), queries (`.sql`), scripts (`.js`/`.ts`), schemas, templates

**Purpose:** Reusable building blocks that agents reference during execution

**Managed by:** Edgit versioning system

**Example:**
```bash
edgit tag create extraction-prompt v1.0.0
edgit deploy set extraction-prompt v1.0.0 --to prod
```

**Used in:**
```yaml
agents:
  - name: analyzer
    component: extraction-prompt@v1.0.0
```

---

### Agent

**What:** An executable unit that performs tasks using operations and components

**Types:**
- **Custom agents** - Defined by you using operations
- **Pre-built agents** - Ships with Conductor (scraper, validator, RAG, etc.)

**Capabilities:**
- Use components
- Use operations
- Access tools (MCP)
- Call other agents
- Call ensembles

**Example:**
```yaml
agents:
  - name: analyzer
    operation: think
    component: prompt@v2.1.0
    config:
      model: claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022
```

---

### Operation

**What:** A primitive execution type that defines HOW something runs

**Purpose:** The "verb" of what an agent does - the execution primitive

**Types:**
- `think` - AI reasoning (LLMs, embeddings, classification)
- `code` - JavaScript/TypeScript execution
- `storage` - Database/KV/R2/D1 operations
- `http` - HTTP requests to external services
- `tools` - MCP/skill access
- `email` - Email operations
- `sms` - SMS operations
- `html` - HTML rendering
- `pdf` - PDF generation
- `page` - Full-stack pages

**Usage:** Operations are used BY agents, not called directly

**Example:**
```yaml
agents:
  - name: fetcher
    operation: http  # Operation type
    config:
      url: https://api.example.com
```

---

### Ensemble

**What:** An orchestration workflow that coordinates multiple agents

**Format:** YAML files in your Git repository

**Purpose:** Defines workflow logic and execution flow

**Capabilities:**
- Orchestrate agents
- Call other ensembles
- Define flow control (sequential, parallel, conditional, loops)
- Manage state
- Map inputs/outputs

**Cannot:**
- Use operations directly (must go through agents)
- Access components directly (must go through agents)

**Example:**
```yaml
ensemble: company-intel

agents:
  - name: fetch
    operation: http

  - name: analyze
    operation: think
    component: prompt@v1.0.0

  - name: store
    operation: storage
```

**Note:** Ensembles are NOT versioned. They're like Kubernetes manifests - you update them to point to different versions of agents and components.

---

### Tool

**What:** External capability accessed via MCP (Model Context Protocol) or other protocols

**Access:** Through the `tools` operation in agents

**Examples:** GitHub MCP, filesystem MCP, Claude skills, custom MCP servers

**Usage:**
```yaml
agents:
  - name: processor
    operation: tools
    config:
      mcp_server: github
      tool: create_issue
    input:
      title: "Bug report"
      body: ${analyze.output}
```

---

## Execution Terms

### State

**What:** Shared data across agents in an ensemble execution

**Properties:**
- Immutable (each update creates new version)
- Scoped to ensemble execution
- Schema-validated
- Access-tracked

**Usage:**
```yaml
state:
  schema:
    company_data: object
    analysis: object

agents:
  - name: fetch
    operation: http
    state:
      set: [company_data]  # Write

  - name: analyze
    operation: think
    state:
      use: [company_data]  # Read
      set: [analysis]       # Write
```

---

### Context

**What:** The runtime environment and data available during agent execution

**Includes:**
- Input data
- Previous agent outputs
- State variables
- Environment variables
- Request metadata

**Accessed via interpolation:**
```yaml
input:
  data: ${fetch.output}           # Previous agent output
  domain: ${input.domain}          # Ensemble input
  company: ${state.company_data}   # State variable
  api_key: ${env.API_KEY}          # Environment variable
```

---

### Interpolation

**What:** Template syntax for referencing dynamic values

**Syntax:** `${source.path.to.value}`

**Sources:**
- `input.*` - Ensemble input
- `<agent-name>.output.*` - Agent outputs
- `state.*` - State variables
- `env.*` - Environment variables

**Examples:**
```yaml
${input.domain}                    # Simple value
${fetch.output.data.company_name}  # Nested object
${state.analyses[0].score}         # Array access
${env.ANTHROPIC_API_KEY}           # Environment
```

---

## Versioning Terms

### Tag

**What:** A Git tag in the format `components/{name}/{version}` or `agents/{name}/{version}`

**Purpose:** Mark specific commits as versions of components or agents

**Examples:**
```bash
components/extraction-prompt/v1.0.0
components/extraction-prompt/prod

agents/scraper/v1.5.0
agents/scraper/prod
```

---

### Deployment

**What:** The act of marking a specific version as active in an environment

**Environments:** Typically `prod`, `staging`, `dev`, `canary` (you define these)

**Example:**
```bash
edgit deploy set extraction-prompt v1.0.0 --to prod
edgit deploy set extraction-prompt v2.0.0-beta --to staging
```

---

### Version Multiverse

**What:** The ability to run multiple versions of components and agents simultaneously

**Purpose:** A/B testing, gradual rollouts, bug reproduction

**Example:**
```yaml
agents:
  # Stable combination
  - name: prod-path
    agent: analyzer@v1.0.0
    component: prompt@v1.0.0

  # Experimental combination
  - name: exp-path
    agent: analyzer@v2.0.0-beta
    component: prompt@v2.1.0

  # Hybrid combination
  - name: hybrid-path
    agent: analyzer@v1.0.0
    component: prompt@v2.1.0
```

---

## Common Patterns

### Component Versioning Pattern

```bash
# Create version
edgit tag create my-component v1.0.0

# Deploy to staging
edgit deploy set my-component v1.0.0 --to staging

# Test and promote to production
edgit deploy set my-component v1.0.0 --to prod
```

---

### Agent Definition Pattern

```yaml
# Custom agent using operation
agents:
  - name: my-agent
    operation: think
    component: prompt@v1.0.0
    config:
      model: claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022
    input:
      data: ${previous-agent.output}
    condition: ${previous-agent.success}
    retry:
      max_attempts: 3
```

---

### Ensemble Orchestration Pattern

```yaml
ensemble: my-workflow
description: Multi-step AI workflow

input:
  domain:
    type: string
    required: true

state:
  schema:
    company_data: object
    analysis: object

agents:
  - name: fetch
    operation: http
    state:
      set: [company_data]

  - name: analyze
    operation: think
    state:
      use: [company_data]
      set: [analysis]

  - name: store
    operation: storage
    state:
      use: [analysis]

output:
  domain: ${input.domain}
  result: ${state.analysis}
```

---

## Capability Matrix

What each entity can do:

| Entity | Use Components | Use Operations | Use Tools | Call Agents | Call Ensembles |
|--------|---------------|----------------|-----------|-------------|----------------|
| **Ensemble** |  |  |  |  |  |
| **Agent** |  |  |  |  |  |
| **Operation** |  | N/A | N/A |  |  |
| **Component** | N/A | N/A | N/A | N/A | N/A |

**Key Insight:** Agents are the only entity that can use operations and components directly. Ensembles orchestrate agents.

---

## Quick Reference

### Common Confusions

**Q: Are ensembles versioned?**
A: No. Ensembles are like Kubernetes manifests - they reference versioned agents and components.

**Q: Can ensembles use operations directly?**
A: No. Ensembles orchestrate agents. Agents use operations.

**Q: What's the difference between an agent and an operation?**
A: Operations are primitives (think, code, http). Agents use operations to do work.

**Q: Can I version scripts?**
A: Yes. Scripts are components and can be versioned with Edgit.

**Q: What's a pre-built agent?**
A: Production-ready agents that ship with Conductor (scraper, validator, RAG, etc.)

**Q: Can agents call other agents?**
A: Yes. Agents can call both other agents and ensembles.
