title: "Ensemble CLI"
description: "One CLI to rule them all - unified access to the entire Ensemble ecosystem"
---

## Overview

The **Ensemble CLI** is the unified command-line interface for the entire Ensemble ecosystem. Instead of installing and managing separate CLIs for each tool, you get a single entry point that orchestrates everything.

```bash
# One command to get started - no installation needed
npx @ensemble-edge/ensemble

# Or run specific commands directly
npx @ensemble-edge/ensemble conductor init my-project   # Create Conductor projects
npx @ensemble-edge/ensemble edgit tag create v1.0.0     # Version components
```

## Why a Unified CLI?

The Ensemble CLI provides a single interface for all tools in the ecosystem:

```bash
# No installation needed - just run with npx
npx @ensemble-edge/ensemble

# Or run specific commands directly
npx @ensemble-edge/ensemble conductor init my-project
npx @ensemble-edge/ensemble edgit tag create prompt v1.0.0
```

**Benefits:**

- **Single installation** - One package to install and update
- **Consistent interface** - Same patterns across all tools
- **Automatic discovery** - CLI suggests related tools as you work
- **Simplified CI/CD** - One binary in your pipelines

## Quick Start

### Getting Started

```bash
# Launch the interactive wizard (recommended)
npx @ensemble-edge/ensemble

# Or run a specific command
npx @ensemble-edge/ensemble conductor init my-project
npx @ensemble-edge/ensemble --help
```

### Verify It Works

```bash
npx @ensemble-edge/ensemble --version
# Output: ensemble v1.0.0

npx @ensemble-edge/ensemble --help
# Shows all available commands
```

## Command Structure

The CLI follows a simple pattern:

```bash
ensemble <tool> <command> [options]
```

### Available Tools

| Tool | Description | Example |
|------|-------------|---------|
| `conductor` | Edge orchestration framework | `ensemble conductor init my-app` |
| `edgit` | Component versioning | `ensemble edgit tag create v1.0.0` |
| `cloud` | Ensemble Cloud management | `ensemble cloud deploy` |
| `chamber` | Secrets management | `ensemble chamber set API_KEY` |
| `wrangler` | Cloudflare Workers CLI (passthrough) | `ensemble wrangler dev` |

## Conductor Commands

Create and manage Conductor projects:

```bash
# Initialize a new project
ensemble conductor init my-project

# With AI provider setup
ensemble conductor init my-project --provider anthropic

# Skip authentication prompts (CI/CD)
ensemble conductor init my-project --skip-auth --skip-secrets

# Development server
ensemble conductor dev

# Deploy to Cloudflare
ensemble conductor deploy
```

### Init Options

| Option | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `--skip-auth` | Skip Wrangler authentication check |
| `--skip-secrets` | Skip AI provider setup |
| `--provider <name>` | Pre-select AI provider (anthropic, openai, cloudflare) |
| `--template <name>` | Use a starter template |

## Edgit Commands

Version and deploy components:

```bash
# Initialize Edgit in a repo
ensemble edgit init

# Register a component
ensemble edgit components add prompt my-prompt prompts/my-prompt.md

# Create a version tag
ensemble edgit tag create my-prompt v1.0.0

# Deploy to an environment
ensemble edgit deploy set my-prompt v1.0.0 --to prod

# List all components
ensemble edgit components list
```

## Cloud Commands

Manage Ensemble Cloud resources:

```bash
# Deploy to Ensemble Cloud
ensemble cloud deploy

# View deployment status
ensemble cloud status

# Stream logs
ensemble cloud logs --follow
```

## Wrangler Passthrough

All Wrangler commands are passed through transparently:

```bash
# These are equivalent:
ensemble wrangler dev
wrangler dev

# Full Wrangler CLI available
ensemble wrangler deploy
ensemble wrangler secret put API_KEY
ensemble wrangler kv:namespace create CACHE
ensemble wrangler d1 create my-database
```

## Cross-Tool Discovery

The CLI intelligently suggests related tools as you work:

```bash
$ ensemble conductor init my-project
✓ Project created successfully!

💡 Next steps:
  • Run 'ensemble edgit init' to enable component versioning
  • Run 'ensemble wrangler dev' to start the development server
```

```bash
$ ensemble edgit tag create my-prompt v1.0.0
✓ Tag created: prompts/my-prompt/v1.0.0

💡 Deploy this version:
  • Run 'ensemble edgit deploy set my-prompt v1.0.0 --to staging'
```

## Environment Variables

| Variable | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `ENSEMBLE_LOG_LEVEL` | Logging verbosity (debug, info, warn, error) |
| `CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN` | Cloudflare authentication |
| `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` | Anthropic API key |
| `OPENAI_API_KEY` | OpenAI API key |

## CI/CD Integration

For CI/CD pipelines, use `npx` to run commands without global installation:

### GitHub Actions

```yaml
name: Deploy
on:
  push:
    branches: [main]

jobs:
  deploy:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4

      - name: Setup Node
        uses: actions/setup-node@v4
        with:
          node-version: '20'

      - name: Build & Deploy
        run: |
          npx @ensemble-edge/conductor build
          npx wrangler deploy
        env:
          CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN }}
```

### GitLab CI

```yaml
deploy:
  image: node:20
  script:
    - npx @ensemble-edge/conductor build
    - npx wrangler deploy
  variables:
    CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN: $CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN
```

### Direct Product Init for CI/CD

For automated pipelines, you can also use the product-specific init commands with the `-y` flag to skip interactive prompts:

```bash
# Non-interactive Conductor init
npx @ensemble-edge/conductor init my-project -y

# Non-interactive Edgit init
npx @ensemble-edge/edgit init -y
```

## Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Command not found after installation">
    Ensure your global npm/pnpm bin directory is in your PATH:

    ```bash
    # Check where packages are installed
    pnpm bin -g

    # Add to PATH (add to ~/.bashrc or ~/.zshrc)
    export PATH="$(pnpm bin -g):$PATH"
    ```
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Permission errors or installation issues">
    Use `npx` to avoid global installation entirely:

    ```bash
    # No installation needed - just run with npx
    npx @ensemble-edge/ensemble
    ```

    Or use a Node version manager like nvm or fnm for global installs:

    ```bash
    # Install nvm
    curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nvm-sh/nvm/v0.39.0/install.sh | bash

    # Install and use Node
    nvm install 20
    nvm use 20
    ```
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Wrangler commands not working">
    The Ensemble CLI passes through to Wrangler. Ensure you're authenticated:

    ```bash
    ensemble wrangler login
    ensemble wrangler whoami
    ```
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>
