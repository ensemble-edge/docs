## Overview

The Conductor CLI provides command-line tools for executing members, testing workflows, inspecting state, and managing your Conductor projects. Perfect for local development, debugging, and CI/CD pipelines.

## Installation

```bash
npm install @ensemble-edge/conductor
```

Or globally:

```bash
npm install -g @ensemble-edge/conductor
```

## Quick Start

```bash
# Execute a member locally
conductor exec my-member --input '{"key": "value"}'

# List available members
conductor members list

# Check API health
conductor health --api-url https://your-worker.workers.dev

# Run tests
conductor test
```

## Configuration

Set up your environment:

```bash
# API URL
export CONDUCTOR_API_URL=https://your-worker.workers.dev

# API Key (if using authentication)
export CONDUCTOR_API_KEY=your-api-key
```

Check current configuration:

```bash
conductor config
```

## Available Commands

### init

Initialize a new Conductor project:

```bash
# Create new project with examples
conductor init my-project

# Create minimal project without examples
conductor init my-project --no-examples

# Force overwrite existing directory
conductor init my-project --force

# Use specific template
conductor init my-project --template cloudflare
```

**Options**:
- `--no-examples` - Skip example files (ensembles, members, templates, etc.) for a clean start
- `-f, --force` - Overwrite existing directory if it exists
- `--template <name>` - Use specific project template (default: cloudflare)

**What gets created**:
- Project structure with `members/`, `ensembles/`, `templates/`, etc.
- Starter configuration files
- Example files (unless `--no-examples` is used)
- README with quickstart instructions

<Tip>
Use `--no-examples` when creating production projects to start with a clean slate. Examples are helpful for learning but add clutter to production codebases.
</Tip>

### exec

Execute a member locally or remotely:

```bash
# Execute with inline JSON
conductor exec my-member --input '{"name": "Alice"}'

# Execute from file
conductor exec my-member --file input.json

# Execute remotely via API
conductor exec my-member --remote --input '{"data": "test"}'

# Custom configuration
conductor exec my-member --config '{"timeout": 5000}' --input '{}'
```

**Options**:
- `-i, --input <json>` - Input data as JSON string
- `-f, --file <path>` - Input data from JSON file
- `-c, --config <json>` - Member configuration as JSON
- `--remote` - Execute via API instead of locally
- `--api-url <url>` - API URL (overrides env var)
- `--api-key <key>` - API key (overrides env var)
- `--output <format>` - Output format: `json`, `pretty`, or `raw` (default: pretty)

### members

List and inspect available members:

```bash
# List all members
conductor members list

# Show member details
conductor members show my-member

# List by type
conductor members list --type Think
```

### test

Run workflow tests:

```bash
# Run all tests
conductor test

# Run specific test file
conductor test path/to/test.ts

# Watch mode
conductor test --watch

# Coverage
conductor test --coverage
```

### health

Check API health:

```bash
# Check health
conductor health

# Custom API URL
conductor health --api-url https://staging.conductor.dev
```

### history

View execution history:

```bash
# List recent executions
conductor history

# Show execution details
conductor history show exec_abc123

# Filter by status
conductor history --status failed

# Filter by ensemble
conductor history --ensemble user-onboarding
```

### logs

View execution logs:

```bash
# Tail logs
conductor logs --tail

# Show logs for execution
conductor logs exec_abc123

# Follow logs in real-time
conductor logs --follow
```

### state

Inspect execution state:

```bash
# Show current state
conductor state show exec_abc123

# List state history
conductor state history exec_abc123

# Export state
conductor state export exec_abc123 --output state.json
```

### replay

Replay past executions:

```bash
# Replay execution
conductor replay exec_abc123

# Replay with different input
conductor replay exec_abc123 --input '{"modified": true}'

# Replay from specific step
conductor replay exec_abc123 --from-step 3
```

### docs

Generate API documentation with optional AI enhancement:

```bash
# Generate OpenAPI spec (YAML by default)
conductor docs

# Generate with AI-powered descriptions
conductor docs --ai

# Output to specific file
conductor docs --output openapi.json

# Generate as JSON instead of YAML
conductor docs --json

# Validate existing OpenAPI spec
conductor docs validate
conductor docs validate openapi.json
```

**Options**:
- `--ai` - Use AI to enhance documentation (requires `docs-writer` member in your project)
- `-o, --output <path>` - Output file path (default: `./openapi.yaml`)
- `--json` - Output as JSON instead of YAML

**AI-Powered Documentation**:

When you use the `--ai` flag, Conductor automatically:
1. Scans your ensembles and members
2. Generates base OpenAPI spec
3. Uses your `docs-writer` member to enhance descriptions with AI
4. Produces high-quality, context-aware API documentation

<Tip>
The `--ai` flag requires a `docs-writer` member (Think type) in your `members/` directory. See the [AI Documentation Guide](/conductor/guides/ai-documentation) for setup instructions.
</Tip>

**What gets excluded**:
- All files in `/examples/` directories are automatically skipped
- Example ensembles and members don't appear in generated docs
- Only production endpoints are documented

**Subcommands**:
- `conductor docs validate [file]` - Validate OpenAPI specification format

### config

Show current configuration:

```bash
conductor config
```

## Usage Examples

### Local Development

Execute members locally during development:

```bash
# Test a Think member
conductor exec analyze-sentiment \
  --input '{"text": "I love this product!"}' \
  --config '{"model": "claude-3-haiku-20240307"}'

# Test with file input
echo '{"email": "test@example.com"}' > input.json
conductor exec validate-email --file input.json
```

### Testing Workflows

Run tests before deployment:

```bash
# Run all tests
conductor test

# Run specific test suite
conductor test ensembles/user-onboarding.test.ts

# Generate coverage report
conductor test --coverage --reporter=lcov
```

### Debugging

Debug execution issues:

```bash
# View execution history
conductor history --limit 10

# Check failed executions
conductor history --status failed

# Inspect specific execution
conductor state show exec_abc123

# Replay failed execution
conductor replay exec_abc123
```

### CI/CD Integration

Use CLI in GitHub Actions:

```yaml
name: Test Conductor Workflows

on: [push]

jobs:
  test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3

      - name: Install dependencies
        run: npm install

      - name: Run Conductor tests
        run: conductor test --coverage
        env:
          CONDUCTOR_API_URL: ${{ secrets.CONDUCTOR_API_URL }}
          CONDUCTOR_API_KEY: ${{ secrets.CONDUCTOR_API_KEY }}

      - name: Check API health
        run: conductor health
```

### Remote Execution

Execute workflows on deployed API:

```bash
# Set API credentials
export CONDUCTOR_API_URL=https://your-worker.workers.dev
export CONDUCTOR_API_KEY=your-api-key

# Execute remotely
conductor exec process-order --remote \
  --input '{"orderId": "ORD-123"}'

# Check execution status
conductor history
```

## Output Formats

Control output format:

```bash
# Pretty (default) - human-readable
conductor exec my-member --output pretty

# JSON - machine-readable
conductor exec my-member --output json | jq '.output'

# Raw - just the output value
conductor exec my-member --output raw
```

## Best Practices

1. **Use environment variables** - Configure API URL and key via env vars
2. **Test locally first** - Use local execution before remote
3. **Enable verbose logging** - Use `--verbose` for debugging
4. **Integrate with CI/CD** - Automate testing in pipelines
5. **Use file input** - Store test inputs in JSON files
6. **Check health regularly** - Monitor API availability
7. **Review execution history** - Track workflow performance
8. **Replay for debugging** - Reproduce issues with replay
9. **Generate docs** - Keep API documentation up to date
10. **Version control configs** - Track configuration changes

## Troubleshooting

### Command not found

```bash
# Install globally
npm install -g @ensemble-edge/conductor

# Or use npx
npx conductor --version
```

### API connection issues

```bash
# Check configuration
conductor config

# Verify API URL and key
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer $CONDUCTOR_API_KEY" \
  $CONDUCTOR_API_URL/health
```

### Execution failures

```bash
# Check logs
conductor logs exec_abc123

# Inspect state
conductor state show exec_abc123

# Replay with verbose output
conductor replay exec_abc123 --verbose
```
