# Pulse

**Anonymous usage metrics that help improve Conductor.**

Conductor Pulse collects anonymous usage metrics to help us understand how the platform
is used and prioritize improvements. It's enabled by default and sends minimal, non-identifying
data when your Conductor Worker starts.

## What We Collect

| Data Point | Description |
|------------|-------------|
| **Project ID** | A random UUID generated when you run `conductor init` |
| **Event type** | What happened (e.g., `server.start`) |
| **Version** | Which version of Conductor you're using |
| **Agent count** | How many agents your project has |
| **Ensemble count** | How many ensembles your project has |
| **Component count** | Total number of components |
| **Country** | Derived from Cloudflare's edge location (colo), not your IP |

## What We DON'T Collect

- Your IP address
- Project names or file contents
- Agent or ensemble names
- Prompts, schemas, or configurations
- API keys or any secrets
- Any personally identifiable information

## How to Opt Out

### Option 1: Config file

```typescript
// conductor.config.ts
export default {
  cloud: {
    pulse: false,
  },
  // ...
}
```

### Option 2: Environment variable

```bash
# Standard opt-out (respects DO_NOT_TRACK convention)
DO_NOT_TRACK=1

# Or Conductor-specific
CONDUCTOR_PULSE=false
```

<Note>
Environment variables take precedence over config file settings. If `DO_NOT_TRACK=1` is set,
Pulse will be disabled regardless of your config.
</Note>

## How It Works

1. When you run `conductor init`, a unique project ID (UUID) is generated and stored in your `conductor.config.ts`
2. On each Worker cold start, Pulse sends a single lightweight request to `pulse.ensemble.ai`
3. The request is fire-and-forget using `ctx.waitUntil()` - it never blocks your Worker
4. If the network request fails, it's silently ignored

### Upgraded Projects

If you're upgrading from an older version of Conductor that doesn't have a project ID in your config,
Pulse will auto-generate an ephemeral ID at runtime. This means:

- Your metrics will still be collected (unless you opt out)
- Each cold start may generate a different ID until you add one to your config
- To get consistent tracking, run `conductor init .` to add a project ID to your existing project

## Why We Collect Pulse Metrics

- **Prioritize features**: See which parts of Conductor are most used
- **Track adoption**: Understand version migration patterns
- **Geographic insights**: Optimize edge performance by region
- **Project complexity**: Guide documentation based on typical project sizes

## Where Data Goes

Pulse signals are sent to `pulse.ensemble.ai`, a minimal Cloudflare Worker that writes
to Workers Analytics Engine. Data is aggregated and never shared with third parties.

## Technical Details

### Payload Schema

```typescript
interface PulsePayload {
  pid: string      // Project ID (UUID)
  e: string        // Event type (e.g., "server.start")
  v: string        // Conductor version
  cc: number       // Component count
  ac: number       // Agent count
  ec: number       // Ensemble count
  ts: number       // Timestamp
}
```

### Request Details

- **Endpoint**: `https://pulse.ensemble.ai`
- **Method**: POST
- **Timeout**: 5 seconds (non-blocking)
- **Retry**: None (fire-and-forget)

## Privacy-First Design

Pulse was designed with privacy as the top priority:

1. **No IP Logging**: We derive country from Cloudflare's edge location, not your IP
2. **Random IDs**: Project IDs are UUIDs with no relation to your actual project
3. **Minimal Data**: We only collect what's needed for aggregate statistics
4. **Easy Opt-Out**: Multiple ways to disable, respecting industry standards
5. **Transparent**: This documentation tells you exactly what we collect
