## What is Conductor?

Conductor is a production-ready orchestration framework for building AI workflows that execute at the edge with sub-50ms cold starts. Think of it as sheet music for your AI systems - you define **ensembles** (workflows) that coordinate **members** (AI models, functions, databases, APIs) to accomplish complex tasks.

```bash
npm install @ensemble-edge/conductor
```

<Info>
  **Terminology Note:** Conductor uses musical metaphors consistently:
  - **Ensembles** = Workflows (YAML files that orchestrate execution)
  - **Members** = Agents/Components (individual units that perform specific tasks)

  This naming helps distinguish Conductor's approach from traditional "workflow" and "agent" frameworks while making orchestration concepts intuitive and memorable.

## The Musical Metaphor

Conductor uses a memorable metaphor that makes complex orchestration intuitive:

  <Card title="Members = Musicians" icon="user">
    Each member plays one instrument (role): AI reasoning, JavaScript logic, database queries, HTTP requests

## Core Features

### Edge-Native Execution
Execute workflows on Cloudflare's global network with **sub-50ms cold starts** at 200+ locations worldwide.

### Four Member Types
- **Think** - AI reasoning with GPT-4, Claude, Workers AI, Groq
- **Function** - JavaScript/TypeScript business logic
- **Data** - KV, D1, R2, Vectorize storage operations
- **API** - HTTP requests to external services

### Six Built-In Members
Production-ready members you can use immediately:
- **scrape** - Web scraping with 3-tier fallback strategy
- **validate** - Quality evaluation with 4 evaluator types
- **autorag** - Fully managed RAG with R2 (easiest)
- **vectorize-rag** - Manual Vectorize RAG (flexible)
- **hitl** - Human-in-the-Loop approval workflows
- **fetch** - HTTP client with retry logic
- **queries** - SQL execution with Hyperdrive

### State Management
Shared state across ensemble execution with immutable updates, selective member access, and comprehensive tracking.

### Quality Scoring
Built-in quality validation with confidence thresholds, automatic retry logic, and progressive improvement loops.

### Testing Framework
First-class testing support with TestConductor, custom Vitest matchers, and mock providers.

## Quick Example

Create a simple greeting ensemble:

```yaml
# ensembles/greet.yaml
name: greet
description: Greet a user by name

flow:
  - member: generate-greeting
    input:
      name: ${input.name}

output:
  message: ${generate-greeting.output.message}
```

Create the member:

```typescript
// members/generate-greeting/index.ts
export default async function generateGreeting({ input }) {
  return {
    message: `Hello, ${input.name}! Welcome to Conductor.`
  };
}
```

Execute the ensemble:

```typescript
import { Executor } from '@ensemble-edge/conductor';

const executor = new Executor({ env, ctx });
const result = await executor.executeFromYAML(yamlContent, {
  name: 'World'
});

console.log(result.output.message); // "Hello, World! Welcome to Conductor."
```

## Integration with Edgit

Conductor and [Edgit](/edgit/overview) work together to provide complete versioning for AI systems:

**What Edgit Versions:**
- Member configurations (`member.yaml`)
- Prompts for Think members
- SQL queries for Data members

**What Git Versions:**
- Member implementations (`index.ts`)
- Ensembles (YAML workflows)

**Example:**
```yaml
# Reference versioned prompt from Edgit
members:
  - name: analyze-company
    type: Think
    config:
      prompt: company-analysis-prompt@v1.2.0  # Edgit component
      model: claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022
```

<Note>
  Edgit integration is planned for a future release. Currently use local files or inline configurations.

## Architecture Highlights

### Three-Layer Platform System
Clean separation enabling multi-cloud support:
1. **AI Providers** - OpenAI, Anthropic, Workers AI, Groq, custom
2. **Cloud Platforms** - Cloudflare (future: Vercel, AWS, Azure)
3. **Base Interfaces** - Platform-agnostic abstractions

### Result-Based Error Handling
No throwing exceptions in core runtime - explicit `Result<T, E>` types for predictable error propagation.

### Immutable State Management
StateManager returns new instances on every mutation - functional programming approach for predictable state transitions.

### Composition Over Inheritance
- Provider registry pattern for AI providers
- Repository pattern for storage abstractions
- Resolver chain for template interpolation

### Lazy Loading
Built-in members load on demand for faster cold starts and smaller bundle sizes.
