# Conductor


**Edge-native orchestration for AI workflows. &lt;50ms cold starts. 200+ global locations. No servers to manage.**

Define workflows in YAML. Deploy to Cloudflare Workers. State management, caching, parallelization built-in.

## What Conductor Does

Conductor is a production-ready orchestration framework for building AI workflows that execute at the edge. You define **ensembles** (workflows) in YAML that coordinate **agents** (workers) using **operations** (execution primitives) to accomplish complex tasks.

**No DAG builders. No UI-driven workflows. No central orchestrator bottleneck.**

Just YAML files in Git that deploy to Cloudflare Workers.

## Why Edge-Native Matters

**Traditional Orchestrators** (Airflow, Temporal, Prefect):
- Centralized servers (single region)
- Slow cold starts (2-5 seconds)
- Infrastructure management required
- Geographic latency

**Conductor (Edge-Native)**:
- Distributed compute (200+ regions)
- Fast cold starts (&lt;50ms)
- Zero infrastructure management
- Near-zero latency globally

## Quick Example

Create `ensembles/company-intel.yaml`:

```yaml
ensemble: company-intel
description: Fetch and analyze company data

agents:
  # Fetch company data
  - name: fetch
    operation: http
    config:
      url: https://api.company-data.com/lookup?domain=${input.domain}
      cache_ttl: 3600  # Cache for 1 hour

  # Analyze with AI
  - name: analyze
    operation: think
    component: analysis-prompt@v2.1.0  # Versioned prompt via Edgit
    config:
      model: claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022
    input:
      company_data: ${fetch.output}

  # Validate quality
  - name: score
    agent: validator  # Pre-built agent
    input:
      content: ${analyze.output}

output:
  domain: ${input.domain}
  analysis: ${analyze.output}
  quality_score: ${score.output.score}
  cached: ${fetch.cached}
```

Deploy it:

```bash
conductor deploy
# Live at: https://your-worker.workers.dev/ensembles/company-intel
```

Test it:

```bash
curl https://your-worker.workers.dev/ensembles/company-intel \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"domain": "stripe.com"}'
```

**You're running AI workflows at the edge in &lt;5 minutes.**

## Core Components

### 1. Operations (Execution Primitives)

Operations define **HOW** agents execute. They're the "verbs" of what agents do:

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="think" icon="brain">
    AI reasoning - GPT-4, Claude, Workers AI
  </Card>

  <Card title="code" icon="code">
    JavaScript/TypeScript - Business logic
  </Card>

  <Card title="storage" icon="database">
    Database - KV, D1, R2, Vectorize
  </Card>

  <Card title="http" icon="globe">
    HTTP requests - External APIs
  </Card>

  <Card title="tools" icon="wrench">

  </Card>

  <Card title="email" icon="envelope">
    Email - Sending, templates
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

### 2. Agents (Workers)

Agents are executable units that use operations to perform tasks:

**Custom Agents** (you define):
```yaml
agents:
  - name: analyzer
    operation: think
    component: prompt@v2.1.0
    config:
      model: claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022
```

**Pre-built Agents** (ship with Conductor):
```yaml
agents:
  - name: scraper
    agent: scraper  # Use pre-built
    config:
      url: https://example.com
```

Available pre-built agents:
- `scraper` - Web scraping with 3-tier fallback
- `validator` - Quality scoring with multiple evaluators
- `rag` - RAG pipeline with R2 storage
- `hitl` - Human-in-the-loop approval workflows
- `fetcher` - HTTP with retry logic
- `transformer` - Data transformation utilities
- `scheduler` - Delayed/scheduled execution

[View all agents �](/conductor/agents/overview)

### 3. Ensembles (Orchestration)

Ensembles are YAML files that coordinate agents into workflows:

```yaml
ensemble: my-workflow

agents:
  # Sequential by default
  - name: fetch
    operation: http

  - name: analyze
    operation: think

  # Parallel execution
  - parallel:
      - name: financial-analysis
        operation: think
      - name: legal-analysis
        operation: think

  # Conditional execution
  - name: manual-review
    agent: hitl
    condition: ${analyze.score < 0.8}

output:
  result: ${analyze.output}
  required_review: ${manual-review.completed}
```

## Key Features

### State Management

Share data across agents with immutable state:

```yaml
state:
  schema:
    company_data: object
    analyses: array

agents:
  - name: fetch
    operation: http
    state:
      set: [company_data]  # Write to state

  - name: analyze
    operation: think
    state:
      use: [company_data]  # Read from state
      set: [analyses]       # Append to array
```

### Caching

Three cache layers for optimal performance:

```yaml
agents:
  - name: fetch
    operation: http
    config:
      cache_ttl: 3600  # KV cache for 1 hour

  - name: analyze
    operation: think
    config:
      model: claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022
      # AI Gateway caches automatically
```

First request: ~200ms
Cached request: &lt;10ms

### Flow Control

**Sequential** (default), **parallel**, **conditional**, **loops**, **retry**:

```yaml
agents:
  # Sequential
  - name: step1
    operation: http

  - name: step2
    operation: think

  # Parallel
  - parallel:
      - name: task-a
        operation: think
      - name: task-b
        operation: think

  # Conditional
  - name: fallback
    operation: think
    condition: ${step2.failed}

  # Loop
  - name: process-batch
    operation: code
    loop:
      items: ${input.items}

  # Retry
  - name: api-call
    operation: http
    retry:
      max_attempts: 3
      backoff: exponential
```

### A/B Testing

Test multiple variants simultaneously:

```yaml
ensemble: ab-test

agents:
  # Variant A: GPT-4 with conservative prompt
  - name: variant-a
    operation: think
    component: conservative-prompt@v1.0.0
    config:
      model: gpt-4

  # Variant B: Claude with aggressive prompt
  - name: variant-b
    operation: think
    component: aggressive-prompt@v2.0.0
    config:
      model: claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022

output:
  variant_a_result: ${variant-a.output}
  variant_b_result: ${variant-b.output}
  # Compare and pick winner
```

## Integration with Edgit

Conductor and [Edgit](/edgit/overview) work together for complete versioning:

**Edgit versions:**
- Components (prompts, configs, queries, scripts)
- Agent implementations

**Git versions:**
- Ensemble definitions (YAML files)
- Code in your repository

**Example:**

```yaml
ensemble: versioned-workflow

agents:
  - name: scraper
    agent: scraper@v1.5.0          # Versioned agent via Edgit

  - name: analyzer
    operation: think
    component: analysis-prompt@v2.1.0  # Versioned component via Edgit
    config:
      model: claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022

  - name: validator
    agent: validator@v1.0.0        # Versioned agent via Edgit
```

Mix optimal versions from different points in history. Rollback one component without touching anything else.

## Platform Integration

### Cloudflare Workers

Conductor runs on Cloudflare Workers with access to the full platform:

- **KV** - Key-value storage for caching
- **D1** - SQL database for structured data
- **R2** - Object storage for documents
- **Vectorize** - Vector database for embeddings
- **Durable Objects** - Strongly consistent state for HITL
- **AI Gateway** - Caching and observability for AI providers
- **Workers AI** - On-platform AI models

### Configuration

Simple `wrangler.toml` configuration:

```toml
name = "my-ai-workflow"
main = "src/index.ts"
compatibility_date = "2024-11-01"

# KV for caching
[[kv_namespaces]]
binding = "CACHE"
id = "your_kv_namespace_id"

# D1 for structured data
[[d1_databases]]
binding = "DB"
database_name = "analytics"
database_id = "your_d1_database_id"

# AI Gateway
[ai]
binding = "AI_GATEWAY"
gateway_id = "your_gateway_id"
```
