    **Example**: Daily data pipeline with extraction, transformation, and loading
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion icon="scale-balanced" title="Load Balancing">
    Distribute work across multiple agent instances for scalability.

    **Example**: Parallel processing of user requests across agent pool
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Integration with Edgit

Conductor leverages Edgit's component registry:

- **Agent Discovery**: Automatically discover agents registered in Edgit
- **Version Management**: Use Git tags for workflow versioning
- **Deployment**: Deploy workflows alongside agents
- **Observability**: Track which workflow versions use which agent versions
