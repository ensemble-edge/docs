<Note type="warning">
**Built-in** - These agents are part of the Conductor framework itself. You can configure them, but cannot modify their source code.
</Note>

## What Are Built-in Agents?

Built-in agents are framework-level components that require deep integration with Cloudflare's platform:

- **Durable Objects** for stateful operations
- **Cloudflare AI** for embeddings and inference
- **Vectorize** for vector storage and search

Unlike [starter kit agents](/conductor/starter-kit/overview) which you own and can modify, built-in agents are maintained by the Conductor team and updated with framework releases.

## Built-in vs Starter Kit

| Aspect | Built-in Agents | Starter Kit Agents |
|--------|-----------------|-------------------|
| **Source code** | Framework (not editable) | Your project (fully editable) |
| **Updates** | With Conductor releases | You control |
| **Platform deps** | Deep (DO, AI, Vectorize) | Minimal |
| **Customization** | Config only | Full code access |
| **Examples** | rag, hitl | fetch, validate, scrape, etc. |

## When to Use Built-in Agents

**Use `rag` when you need:**
- Manual control over document indexing
- Custom chunking strategies
- Hybrid search (vector + keyword)
- Fine-tuned retrieval parameters

**Use `hitl` when you need:**
- Human approval workflows
- Asynchronous task completion
- Audit trails for decisions
- Multi-step approval chains

## Configuration Pattern

Built-in agents are configured, not coded:

```yaml
agents:
  - name: search-docs
    agent: rag
    config:
      vectorBinding: DOCS_VECTORS
      aiBinding: AI
      model: '@cf/baai/bge-base-en-v1.5'
      topK: 5
    input:
      query: ${input.question}
      operation: search
```

## Starter Kit Alternatives

For simpler use cases, consider starter kit agents:

| Need | Built-in | Starter Kit Alternative |
|------|----------|------------------------|
| RAG with zero config | - | [autorag](/conductor/starter-kit/autorag) |
| Simple validation | - | [validate](/conductor/starter-kit/validate) |
| HTTP requests | - | [fetch](/conductor/starter-kit/fetch) |
