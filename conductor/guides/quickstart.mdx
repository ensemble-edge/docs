---

## Overview

This guide walks you through creating your first Conductor project from scratch. You'll build a simple AI-powered greeting ensemble that demonstrates core concepts: members, ensembles, and execution.

**Time to complete:** 5 minutes

## Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+ installed
- Cloudflare account (free tier works)
- Basic understanding of YAML and TypeScript

## Step 1: Create a New Project

Install Conductor globally and create a new project:

```bash
# Install conductor CLI
npm install -g @ensemble-edge/conductor

# Create new project
conductor init my-first-project

# Navigate to project
cd my-first-project
```

The `conductor init` command creates:
- Project structure with example ensemble
- Member implementations
- Cloudflare Workers configuration
- Git repository

## Step 2: Explore the Project Structure

```
my-first-project/
├── src/
│   └── index.ts              # Worker entry point
├── members/
│   └── greet/
│       ├── member.yaml       # Member configuration
│       └── index.ts          # Member implementation
├── ensembles/
│   └── hello-world.yaml      # Ensemble definition
├── wrangler.toml             # Cloudflare config
└── package.json
```

## Step 3: Understand the Example Member

Open `members/greet/member.yaml`:

```yaml
name: greet
type: Function
description: Generate a personalized greeting

schema:
  input:
    type: object
    properties:
      name:
        type: string
        description: Name to greet
    required: [name]

  output:
    type: object
    properties:
      message:
        type: string
```

Open `members/greet/index.ts`:

```typescript
export default async function greet({ input }) {
  const { name } = input;

  return {
    message: `Hello, ${name}! Welcome to Conductor.`
  };
}
```

**Key concepts:**
- **member.yaml** - Configuration and schema
- **index.ts** - Implementation logic
- **input/output** - Typed parameters

## Step 4: Understand the Example Ensemble

Open `ensembles/hello-world.yaml`:

```yaml
name: hello-world
description: Simple greeting workflow

flow:
  - member: greet
    input:
      name: ${input.name}

output:
  greeting: ${greet.output.message}
```

**Key concepts:**
- **flow** - Execution steps
- **input** - Accepts parameters
- **output** - Returns results
- **${...}** - Template interpolation

## Step 5: Run Locally

Start the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

This starts Wrangler on `http://localhost:8787`

## Step 6: Execute Your First Ensemble

Open a new terminal and test the ensemble:

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8787/api/v1/execute \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "ensemble": "hello-world",
    "input": {
      "name": "World"
    }
  }'
```

Response:

```json
{
  "success": true,
  "output": {
    "greeting": "Hello, World! Welcome to Conductor."
  },
  "executionTime": 12,
  "cached": false
}
```

Congratulations! You've executed your first ensemble!

## Step 7: Add an AI Member

Let's add a Think member that uses AI. Create a new member:

```bash
conductor add member analyze-sentiment Think
```

This creates `members/analyze-sentiment/` with:

**member.yaml:**
```yaml
name: analyze-sentiment
type: Think
description: Analyze sentiment of text

config:
  provider: openai
  model: gpt-4o-mini
  routing: cloudflare-gateway
  temperature: 0.3
  systemPrompt: |
    Analyze the sentiment of the given text.
    Respond with: positive, negative, or neutral.
    Be concise.

schema:
  input:
    type: object
    properties:
      text:
        type: string
    required: [text]

  output:
    type: object
    properties:
      sentiment:
        type: string
      confidence:
        type: number
```

**index.ts:**
```typescript
// Think members are handled by Conductor runtime
// No implementation needed!
export default null;
```

<Note>
  Think members don't require implementation - Conductor handles AI provider calls automatically.
</Note>

## Step 8: Create an Ensemble with AI

Create `ensembles/sentiment-analysis.yaml`:

```yaml
name: sentiment-analysis
description: Analyze sentiment of user input

flow:
  # Step 1: Analyze sentiment with AI
  - member: analyze-sentiment
    input:
      text: ${input.text}

  # Step 2: Format result with Function member
  - member: greet
    input:
      name: ${input.name}

output:
  sentiment: ${analyze-sentiment.output.sentiment}
  confidence: ${analyze-sentiment.output.confidence}
  greeting: ${greet.output.message}
```

## Step 9: Configure AI Provider

Add your OpenAI API key to `.dev.vars`:

```bash
# .dev.vars (create this file)
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-...
```

<Warning>
  Never commit `.dev.vars` to git. It's already in `.gitignore`.
</Warning>

## Step 10: Test the AI Ensemble

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8787/api/v1/execute \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "ensemble": "sentiment-analysis",
    "input": {
      "text": "I absolutely love this product! Best purchase ever!",
      "name": "Customer"
    }
  }'
```

Response:

```json
{
  "success": true,
  "output": {
    "sentiment": "positive",
    "confidence": 0.95,
    "greeting": "Hello, Customer! Welcome to Conductor."
  },
  "executionTime": 1203
}
```

## Step 11: Add Caching

Caching saves money by reusing AI responses. Update `ensembles/sentiment-analysis.yaml`:

```yaml
name: sentiment-analysis
description: Analyze sentiment with caching

flow:
  - member: analyze-sentiment
    input:
      text: ${input.text}
    cache:
      ttl: 3600  # Cache for 1 hour

  - member: greet
    input:
      name: ${input.name}

output:
  sentiment: ${analyze-sentiment.output.sentiment}
  confidence: ${analyze-sentiment.output.confidence}
  greeting: ${greet.output.message}
```

Test again with the same input - notice the `cached: true` in response and much faster execution time!

## Step 12: Deploy to Production

Deploy your project to Cloudflare Workers:

```bash
# Login to Cloudflare (if not already)
npx wrangler login

# Deploy
npm run deploy
```

Your ensemble is now live on Cloudflare's global network!

```bash
# Test production deployment
curl -X POST https://my-first-project.your-subdomain.workers.dev/api/v1/execute \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "ensemble": "sentiment-analysis",
    "input": {
      "text": "This is amazing!",
      "name": "User"
    }
  }'
```
